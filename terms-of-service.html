               <p>Updated on 20/12/2021</p>
            </div>
						<p>Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our products, services and applications, including, but not limited to, our web interface located at <a href="https://endframe.ml/">https://endframe.ml/</a> (“Site”).</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and EndFrame. As used in these Terms, “we”, “us”, or “our” also refers to EndFrame. You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and any other terms and conditions that we may reference or incorporate into these Terms from time to time.</p>
						<p><b>We provide plain language summaries for the convenience of our users in order to better contextualize legal terminology that may be confusing. However, you should understand that these are provided only for your convenience and appear in bold and italics under each section. These summaries are not legally binding and don’t supersede the actual terms and conditions described in these Terms. Please make sure to read the Terms, including any document referred to in these Terms of Service, to fully understand your legal requirements.</b></p>
						<p>THE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL BE SETTLED IN BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ALSO AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR A JURY TRIAL.</p>

                  <h4 class="size-3">WHAT THIS TERMS OF SERVICE COVERS</h4>
               </div>
               <div class="style-guide-content-box">
                 <h4>CHANGES TO OUR TERMS OR SERVICES</h4>
								 <p><b>Summary: We sometimes have to change our Terms or our Services, and we can do so if we feel necessary at any time, but we will tell you if these changes are substantial and require that you agree to new Terms before continuing to use our services.</b></p>
								 <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change these Terms along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by requiring you to log in to our Services again and accept the new Terms, and/or by some other means. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content (defined below) from the Services at any time, for any reason in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
								 <p>Our Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>
								 <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms after any changes, you are free to reject them. Unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
                 <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

								 <h4>ELIGIBILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES</h4>
								 <p><b>Summary: To use our Services, you must be able to legally enter into a contract, be of legal age to enter into an Agreement (or have a parent or guardians consent), and if you are agreeing for an entity, you must be authorized to agree to these Terms. You also are agreeing to use this for your personal purposes and to comply with all laws that might apply to you when using our Services.</b></p>
                 <p>To access or use our Services, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. You therefore represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, that you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).</p>
								 <p>If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You will only use the Services for your own personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.</p>
                 <p>If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws or regulations, or you are a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group that is subject to economic sanctions by the United States or other countries, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. If permits and licenses are required for you to use the Services, it is your responsibility to first obtain those prior to such use. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law or regulations.</p>

                 <h4>PRIVACY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
