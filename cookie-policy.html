						<p><b>As a reminder, your use of our Services is at all times subject to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy which incorporate this Cookie Policy. If you see any capitalized but undefined terms used in this Cookie Policy, they have the same meaning as those we give in the <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> or our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</b></p>

               <div class="style-guide-content-box">
                 <h4>A. Cookie Policy</h4>
								 <p>Certain parts of our Services such as our landing page and other areas of our website use cookies and similar technologies such as clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage. Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device, when you use that device to visit a website. We will refer to cookies and similar technologies simply as “Cookies” for the remainder of this Cookie Policy. We use Cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the Site, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base.</p>
								 <p>We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through cookies with other Personal Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us whether you have a Account in use on our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our Services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you. Where we use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, the Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>
                 <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see aboutcookies.org. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.</p>
                 <p>You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work. For convenience, we recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of some of our more attractive features of our Services, but we understand if you are uncomfortable with this and have aimed to design the fundamental features of our Services to be used with Cookies disabled.</p>
                 <p>Further information on cookies can be found at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm</a>, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies">https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies</a>, or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. To explore what Cookie setting are available to you, look in the preferences or options section of your browsers menu.</p>
                 <p>Please see below to learn more about the kinds of cookies we use and for what purpose.</p>

								 <h4>B. WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE AND FOR WHICH PURPOSES?</h4>
								 <p><b>We use the following types of Cookies:</b>
                   <br>•	Essential Cookies These are cookies that are required to provide you with features or services that you have requested. For example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our site. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Site’s performance and may make certain features and services unavailable.
                   <br>•	Functionality Cookies These are cookies that allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering login details and changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to personalize your experience with our Services and avoid the need to re-enter certain information every time you use our Services.
                   <br>•	Performance/Analytical Cookies Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use certain parts our Site such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Site, what pages visitors view on our Site, and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Site. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Site’s content for those who engage with our advertising. We primarily use Google Analytics for our analytics purposes. Please see below for more information about our use of Google Analytics.
                   <br>•	Advertising Cookies Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. These are typically in the form of Cookies placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to those third parties about browsing habits that may help identify if certain services that such third parties provide are being used, identify your interests, retarget you and serve advertisements that are relevant to you. We do not have control or access to such third party Cookies. If you look at one page on our Site, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our Site or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We do not engage in retargeted advertising for children users of our Site.
                   Opt-out options are also available on the websites of the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a>, the <a href="https://youradchoices.com/">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a> and the <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">European Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA)</a>.
                 </p>

								 <p><b>Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies</b></p>
								 <p>The types of Cookies described above may be session Cookies which are temporary Cookies that are only stored on your device while you are visiting our site or persistent Cookies, which are Cookies that are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our site.</p>
								 <p>The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Site, how often you return, how your use of the Site may vary over time, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Site. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience.</p>
                 <p>Your browser may also offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our “Do Not Track” policy is part of our Privacy Policy and can be located there, but generally, because we do not track our users after they leave our Site beyond certain persistent Cookies, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” requests.</p>

								 <h4>C. What is the Google Analytics Cookie and how is it used?</h4>
								 <p>Our Site use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (Google) which is based on Cookies technology. The information generated by the Cookie is usually sent to a Google server in the USA, where it is stored.</p>
								 <p>Because IP anonymization is activated on our Site, your IP address is abbreviated after being received by Google. On EndFrame’s behalf, Google will use the generated information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activities, and to provide the website operator with additional services connected with website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser in connection with Google Analytics is not collated with other data by Google.</p>
                 <p>To learn more about Google Analytics, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> for Google’s privacy policy, and to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. </p>

								 <h4>D. CONSENT TO OUR COOKIE POLICY</h4>
								 <p>If you are not in the EEA or Switzerland and do not opt out when initially presented the option as provided through the various methods on our Services, you are expressly consenting to the collection, use, and sharing of your information by us and the third parties listed above, subject to any third party privacy policies, preferences, and opt-outs available at a third party’s site. You are also expressly consenting to the use of Cookies and sharing of your information by us and each Google entity identified in this Cookies Policy. You can revoke your consent at any time by contacting us or using the opt out functionality we provide directly on our Services, but you should realize that certain information collected through Cookies does not require affirmative consent, and you will not be able to opt out of collection. For more information on these, please reach out to us directly.</p>
